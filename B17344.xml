            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE sincere desire that the King, my Master, has to maintain the Tranquility of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> will not suffer his Majesty to see the great Preparations for War, both by Sea and Land, made by your Lordships, without taking the measures that Prudence (the continual Companion of all his Actions) inspires him with to prevent the Mischiefs, these Warlike Preparations will certainly draw after them.</p>
                  <p>And altho the King perswaded of the Wisdom of your Councils, would not imagine that a State should so easily resolve to take up Arms, and to kindle a War, that in the present Juncture it cannot be otherwise than Fatal to all Christendom: Nevertheless his Majesty cannot believe your Lordships would engage your selves in so great Expences, both at home and abroad, to entertain in Pay so many Foreign Troops, to put to Sea so numerous a Fleet so late in the Season, and to prepare so great a Train of War, if you had not a Design formed answerable to the greatness of these Preparations.</p>
                  <p>All these Circumstances, my Lords, and many others, that I may not here produce, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the King, my Master, with Reason, that this Arming threatens <hi>England:</hi> Wherefore his Majesty hath Commanded me to declare to you on his part, that the bands of Friendship and Alliance between him and the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> will oblige him not only to assist him, but also he will look on the first act of Hostility, that shall be committed by your Troops, or by your Fleet, against his Majesty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> as a manifest rupture of the Peace, and an overt breach with his Crown.</p>
                  <p>I leave to your Lordships Prudence to reflect on the Consequences that such Enterprises may have, his Majesty not having ordered me to make you this Declaration on his part, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his sincere Intention to prevent (as I have already had the honour to tell you) all that may trouble the Peace of <hi>Europe.</hi>

                  <p>THE Great and surprising preparations for War made by your Lorpships by Sea and Land, in a Season when ordinarily all action, especially at Sea, is laid aside, giveing just Cause of surprise and allarm to all Europe, obliges the King my Master, who has had nothing so much in his mind since his accession to the Crown, as a continuation of the Peace, and good Correspondence with this State, to order the Marquess d'<hi>Albyville</hi> his Envoy Extraordinary to know your Highness's Intentions thereby.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty, as their ancient Ally and Confederate, believes it Just to demand this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which he hoped with good Reason to have heard from their Ambassador; but as he sees this devoir of Alliance and Confederation neglected, and that such Power is raised with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out communicating the Intent in the least to him, he finds himself obliged to Reinforce his Fleet, and to put himself in a Condition to maintain the Peace of Christendom.</p>
